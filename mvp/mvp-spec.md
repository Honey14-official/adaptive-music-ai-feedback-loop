### **F1 – Mood & Genre Onboarding**
**Description:**  
A guided onboarding flow to capture initial user preferences (genres, moods, favorite artists) to seed recommendations.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Present genre and mood options during sign-up.
- Save onboarding preferences to **User Preferences DB**.
- Allow optional artist search for deeper personalization.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Load within 2 seconds.
- Mobile responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Store preferences securely (encrypted at rest).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Onboarding completed successfully by ≥90% of new users.
- Data correctly stored in database.

### **F2 – “Not Relevant” Quick Tap**
**Description:**  
Single-tap option on track cards to signal the recommendation engine to avoid similar content.

**Functional Requirements:**
- “Not Relevant” button visible on all recommended tracks.
- Send real-time event to **Feedback Event Store**.
- UI feedback animation to confirm action.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Response time < 300ms.
- No disruption to playback.
- Scales to ≥10k concurrent users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ≥ 80% of taps logged in event store within 1 second.

---

### **F3 – Skip Pattern Detection Engine**
**Description:**  
Analyze skips per genre/artist to detect a shift in taste.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Monitor skip events from **Listening History DB**.
- Trigger detection when skip rate for a category exceeds threshold (e.g., 60% over 3 days).
- Send “retrain” signal to ML pipeline.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Process in near real-time (< 5 seconds delay).
- Handle high throughput data streams.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Skip detection accuracy ≥ 95%.

---

### **F4 – Real-Time Retraining Pipeline**
**Description:**  
Automatically retrains the recommendation model based on new feedback and listening data.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Incremental training to avoid full retrains.
- Deploy new model version without downtime.
- Version control for models.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Retraining time ≤ 10 minutes for 1M users.
- Fault-tolerant with auto-retry.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Updated recommendations available within 30 minutes of trigger.

---

### **F5 – Weekly Playlist Refresh**
**Description:**  
Automated playlist updates to ensure freshness and novelty.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Schedule weekly refresh jobs.
- Ensure no >20% repetition from previous week’s playlist.
- Pull from latest model outputs.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Job success rate ≥ 99%.
- Auto-recovery from failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Playlists refreshed successfully for all active users each week.

---

### **F6 – Engagement Validation Dashboard**
**Description:**  
Analytics dashboard to track engagement changes post-model updates.

**Functional Requirements:**
- Display skip rate, listening time, likes per track.
- Filter by date, genre, and recommendation model version.
- Compare pre- and post-update metrics.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Dashboard load time < 4 seconds.
- Secure access (admin-only).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data accuracy ≥ 98%.
- Updates at least once per hour.

---

## ✅ MVP Success Metrics

- **Skip Rate Reduction:** ≥ 20% decrease within 30 days.
- **Listening Time Increase:** ≥ 15% increase per user.
- **Retention:** ≥ 80% 30-day retention for new users.
