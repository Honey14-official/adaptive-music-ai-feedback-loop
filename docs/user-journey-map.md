## 1. 🎵 Persona: The Genre Explorer (Alex Sharma)

| Stage | Before Our Solution | After Our Solution (With Feedback Loop) | Touchpoints | Emotions |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Discover** | Downloads app after seeing an ad for “personalized playlists.” | Same, but onboarding includes a quick “Music Mood” mini-survey to seed initial recommendations. | App Store, Onboarding Flow | Curious |
| **Onboard** | Gets playlists based on broad genres; feels somewhat generic. | Recommendations tuned using both initial survey and live listening signals in the first session. | Welcome Screen, Playlist Screen | Interested |
| **Engage** | Finds repetition in playlists within 2 weeks; skips increase. | AI detects spike in skips for 90s pop → shifts to indie & emerging artists. | Player Screen, Skip Button, “Not Relevant” Tap | Relieved, Excited |
| **Retain** | Considers switching apps due to boredom. | Retention increases as playlists feel fresh every week without manual effort. | Push Notifications, Playlist Refresh | Loyal |
| **Advocate** | Rarely recommends app to friends. | Shares playlists on social media because they feel unique to his taste. | Share Button, Social Integration | Proud |

## 2. 🎶 Persona: The Loyal Listener (Priya Mehta)

| Stage | Before Our Solution | After Our Solution (With Feedback Loop) | Touchpoints | Emotions |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Discover** | Rejoins music app after trialing others; seeks stability. | Same, but onboarding reassures “Your music taste will evolve, and so will we.” | App Store, Marketing Site | Hopeful |
| **Onboard** | Gets stable playlists but slowly drifts away from recent tastes. | Early AI baseline plus low-effort micro-feedback options during playback. | Playlist Screen, “Like” Button | Satisfied |
| **Engage** | Gradual loss of interest as content doesn’t reflect mood shifts. | AI quietly adapts without explicit settings change — detects subtle taste drift. | Playback, Background Listening | Trusting |
| **Retain** | Stops opening app regularly after 1–2 months. | Maintains weekly engagement because content always feels relevant. | Weekly Playlist Notifications | Content |
| **Advocate** | Passive user; not vocal about app. | Recommends app to peers for “no-maintenance” personalization. | Word-of-Mouth, Group Chats | Supportive |

| Stage | Before Our Solution | After Our Solution (With Feedback Loop) | Touchpoints | Emotions |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Discover** | Tries multiple apps to compare features. | Same, but our onboarding includes a gamified “Find Your First Favorite” challenge. | App Store, Onboarding Flow | Curious, Competitive |
| **Onboard** | Gets generic playlists; feels disconnected. | Immediate personalization using likes, skips, and genre tags in first 2 sessions. | Playlist Creation, Mood Selector | Excited |
| **Engage** | Quickly skips irrelevant songs; frustration builds. | Skips trigger real-time retraining, shifting focus to preferred genres within days. | Player Screen, Skip/Like Buttons | Impressed |
| **Retain** | Deletes app within a week if bored. | Engaged daily in first week → converts to regular listener. | Daily Listening Streaks, Notifications | Hooked |
