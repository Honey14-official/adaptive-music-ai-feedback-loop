## 📌 Component Breakdown

### 1. **User Devices (Mobile, Web App)**
- Entry point for onboarding, playback, and feedback actions.
- Feedback collected in real-time without disrupting playback.

### 2. **Onboarding Module**
- Mood & genre selection at sign-up to seed recommendations.
- Optional gamified “Find Your First Favorite” challenge.

### 3. **Feedback Capture Module**
- “Not Relevant” quick tap button for immediate content filtering.
- Skip tracking for implicit negative feedback.
- Positive feedback captured from likes, replays, and playlist saves.

### 4. **Data Ingestion Layer**
- API Gateway receives events (play, skip, like, “Not Relevant”).
- Event Bus (e.g., Kafka or AWS Kinesis) streams data for processing.

### 5. **Data Storage Layer**
- **User Preferences DB** – Stores static & evolving preference profiles.
- **Feedback Event Store** – Records all skip/like/dislike actions.
- **Listening History DB** – Maintains track history for trend detection.

### 6. **Analytics & Detection**
- Batch or streaming analysis to detect preference shifts.
- Skip pattern detection triggers retraining when thresholds exceeded.

### 7. **AI Model Training Engine**
- Content-based & collaborative filtering models.
- Incremental retraining ensures fast adaptation.
- Outputs new recommendation weights.

### 8. **Recommendation API**
- Serves personalized playlists to user devices.
- Integrates weekly refresh scheduler.

## 🔄 Closed-Loop Learning Flow

1. **Capture** – User skips 90s pop songs and taps “Not Relevant.”
2. **Analyze** – Skip rate for 90s pop jumps above threshold.
3. **Act** – Retraining pipeline updates model with new listening data.
4. **Validate** – Track engagement metrics post-update.

## ⚖ Scalability Considerations
- Event-driven architecture for real-time responsiveness.
- Incremental model retraining to reduce compute cost.
- Sharded databases for high-volume user data.
- CDN caching for static playlist metadata.
