# 🚀 MVP Definition – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## 1. MVP Goal
Deliver a **personalized music recommendation system** that adapts in near real-time to evolving user tastes, using a **closed-loop feedback mechanism** to prevent stale or irrelevant recommendations.

---

## 2. Problem Statement Link
This MVP directly addresses the identified problem:
> “Users lose interest when music recommendation systems fail to adapt to their changing preferences.”

Without adaptation, outdated recommendations lead to churn.  
The MVP ensures **fast detection**, **rapid adaptation**, and **clear measurement** of engagement improvement.

## 3. MVP Scope

### Included Features (Must-Have from Feature List)
1. **Mood-based Onboarding Survey** – Collects mood & genre preferences at signup to seed recommendations.
2. **Gamified “Find Your First Favorite” Challenge** – Engages new users to quickly feed AI with initial likes/dislikes.
3. **“Not Relevant” Quick Tap** – Allows instant feedback without interrupting playback.
4. **Skip Pattern Detection Engine** – Identifies spikes in skips for specific genres/artists.
5. **Real-Time Retraining Pipeline** – Updates recommendation model within hours of significant feedback.
6. **Weekly Playlist Refresh** – Keeps playlists fresh and aligned with latest preferences.
7. **Engagement Validation Metrics** – Confirms whether new recommendations improve listening engagement.

---

### Excluded Features (Future Releases)
- Daily discovery notifications (to be tested post-MVP)
- Social sharing features
- Monthly taste health check
- Referral rewards program
- Passive feedback capture (complexity deferred to V2)

## 4. Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Skip Rate Reduction** | ≥ 20% decrease in skip rate within 2 weeks of using closed-loop feedback | Shows improved relevance of recommendations. |
| **Engagement Lift** | ≥ 15% increase in total listening time per week | Indicates users are enjoying recommendations more. |
| **Retention Rate** | ≥ 80% user retention in first 30 days | Ensures users don’t churn due to outdated playlists. |
| **Feedback Usage** | ≥ 50% of active users use “Not Relevant” feature in first month | Validates that feedback loop is being adopted. |

---

## 5. Assumptions & Risks
### Assumptions
- Users will actively give feedback when provided with an easy, non-intrusive option.
- Real-time retraining will significantly improve recommendation relevance.
- Weekly refresh cadence will prevent playlist stagnation without overwhelming users.

### Risks
- Low adoption of feedback features could limit closed-loop effectiveness.
- Real-time retraining may require higher compute costs than anticipated.
- Poorly tuned model updates could unintentionally degrade recommendations.
