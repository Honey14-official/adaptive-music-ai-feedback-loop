# 🕵 Problem Discovery – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## 1. P – Pinpoint the Symptom
**Goal:** Identify unusual patterns in user behavior or metrics.

**Observation:**  
Over the past 4 weeks, app analytics showed:
- **Skip rate** for 90s pop songs increased by **+35%**.  
- **Average session duration** dropped from **28 minutes → 17 minutes**.  
- A decline in **30-day active user count**.

**Why it’s important:**  
High skip rates and shorter sessions signal **lower engagement** and a possible **mismatch between user preferences and recommendations**.

> **Key Symptom Statement:**  
> A growing segment of users is disengaging because the music recommendations feel outdated and irrelevant.

## 2. E – Extract the Evidence
**Goal:** Gather proof from both data and user voice to ensure the problem is real and not a false alarm.

### Quantitative Data Collected:
- **Genre-based skip analysis:** Spike in skips for 90s pop & early 2000s tracks.  
- **Retention curve:** Drop-off starting in week 3 for long-time users.  
- **Engagement metrics:** Decline in playlist completion rates.

### Qualitative Data Collected:
- **In-app survey (200 respondents):**
  - 48% said *“Recommendations don’t match my current mood.”*
  - 32% said *“Too many old songs.”*
- **App Store & Play Store reviews:** Keywords “repetitive,” “boring,” and “same old songs.”
- **Social listening:** Reddit threads complaining about outdated playlists.

> **Evidence Statement:**  
> Both behavioral analytics and user feedback confirm a mismatch between the AI’s recommendations and current user preferences.

## 3. U – Understand the Users
**Goal:** Identify who is most impacted.

### Segmentation Findings:
- **Most affected:**  
  - Age: 18–34  
  - Long-time users (6+ months on the app)  
  - Genre explorers (listen to 4+ genres per month)
- **Least affected:**  
  - Brand new users (AI has fresh preference data)  
  - Niche listeners (stick to one genre)

**Why it matters:**  
Focusing on the most impacted users helps **prioritize the fix** where it will have the greatest retention impact.

> **User Impact Statement:**  
> Long-time, genre-diverse listeners are most at risk of churn due to outdated recommendations.

## 4. R – Root Cause Analysis
**Goal:** Identify the real cause, not just the visible issue.

### 5 Whys Analysis:
1. **Why** are users skipping songs? → Songs feel outdated.  
2. **Why** outdated? → Model still recommends 90s pop heavily.  
3. **Why** is model doing this? → AI weights old listening history too much.  
4. **Why** not updated? → No recent behavior weighting or negative feedback input.  
5. **Why** no adjustment? → No **closed-loop learning system** to retrain based on skips & “Not Relevant” signals.

**Root Cause Conclusion:**  
The recommendation AI is **static**, depending on **historical data** without adapting to **real-time taste changes**.

## 5. V – Validate the Problem
**Goal:** Confirm the problem is significant, costly, and solvable.

### Validation Actions:
- **Manual intervention test:** Refreshed affected users’ playlists manually → Skip rates dropped by **18%** within 1 week.
- **Focus group follow-up:** 7/10 users reported playlists felt “more fresh” after the refresh.
- **ROI estimate:** Retaining even 10% of at-risk users could increase monthly revenue by 6–8%.

### Success Criteria for Solution:
- Reduce skip rate for outdated songs by **20%** within 1 month of launch.
- Increase average session duration from **17 minutes → 25 minutes**.
- Improve retention rate by **+5% over 90 days**.

> **Validation Statement:**  
> The issue is real, financially significant, and can be addressed by implementing a feedback loop in the recommendation engine.

## ✅ Final Problem Definition
A significant portion of active users is disengaging because the recommendation AI continues to push outdated content, ignoring evolving preferences. This is confirmed by analytics, user feedback, and small-scale experiments. The lack of a feedback loop is the root cause, and solving it has measurable ROI potential.
