 Problem Statement – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning
   
1. Context
The app uses an AI-powered recommendation engine to personalize playlists based on historical listening patterns. Over time, this system has built strong user engagement but struggles when tastes shift rapidly.

2. User Group
Music app users aged 18–34 who actively explore both mainstream and indie genres. They expect playlists to feel fresh, relevant, and aligned with their current mood.

3. Specific Problem
Users receive outdated music recommendations — primarily 90s pop songs — even after their interest has shifted to newer indie music.

4. Cause
The recommendation AI continues to rely heavily on old preference data without a feedback loop to detect and respond to evolving listening patterns in real time.

5. Impact
Reduced session listening time (from 28 minutes to 17 minutes)

Increased skip rates (+35% for 90s pop tracks in the last 3 weeks)

Higher risk of app abandonment as users explore competing platforms

6. Evidence
Behavioral Data: Spike in skip rate and frequent “Not Relevant” taps

User Feedback: Comments like “Songs feel repetitive” and “It’s like the app doesn’t know me anymore”

Retention Metrics: Decline in active users over a 90-day period

7. Desired Outcome
Recommendations should adapt to a user’s evolving taste within one week of change, reducing skip rates and increasing engagement by at least 20%.

Summary Statement
Music app users aged 18–34 who explore diverse genres are receiving outdated recommendations because the AI relies on old preference data without real-time feedback. This causes higher skip rates, lower engagement, and churn. Embedding a closed-loop learning system can help adapt recommendations quickly, improving user satisfaction and retention.
