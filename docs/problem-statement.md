 1. Context :
The app uses an AI-powered recommendation engine to personalize playlists based on historical listening patterns.
While this approach initially drives strong engagement, it fails when user tastes shift rapidly.

2. User Group:
🎯 Target Users:
Music app users aged 18–34 who actively explore both mainstream and indie genres.
They expect playlists to be fresh, relevant, and aligned with their current mood.

3. Specific Problem :
Users are receiving outdated music recommendations — mainly 90s pop songs — even after their interest has shifted to newer indie music.

4. Cause :
The recommendation AI:

Relies heavily on old preference data

Lacks a feedback loop to detect and adapt to evolving tastes

Updates too slowly to reflect real-time user behavior

5. Impact :
📉 Negative Effects:

Session time dropped from 28 minutes → 17 minutes

Skip rate increased by +35% for 90s pop tracks in 3 weeks

Risk of app abandonment as users try competitor platforms

6. Evidence
📊 Supporting Data:

Behavioral Trends: Increased skips & “Not Relevant” taps

User Comments:

“Songs feel repetitive”

“It’s like the app doesn’t know me anymore”

Retention Metrics: Declining active users over 90 days

7. Desired Outcome :
The system should:

Adapt recommendations within 1 week of a taste shift

Reduce skip rates by 20%

Increase engagement and retain users longer

8. Summary Statement :
Music app users aged 18–34 who explore diverse genres are receiving outdated recommendations because the AI relies on old preference data without real-time feedback. This issue is proven by a +35% skip rate increase for 90s pop, a drop in session time from 28 to 17 minutes, and declining active users over 90 days. Without action, churn will rise; with a closed-loop learning system, recommendations can adapt within a week, boosting engagement and retention.
