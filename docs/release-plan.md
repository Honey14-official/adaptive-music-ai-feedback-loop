## 3. Sprint Breakdown

---

### **Sprint 1 ‚Äì Onboarding & Feedback Capture**
**Goal:** Collect user preferences early and enable quick, frictionless feedback.

**User Stories**
1. *As a new user, I want to complete a mood & genre onboarding survey so that I receive relevant playlists immediately.*
2. *As a user, I want to quickly mark songs as ‚ÄúNot Relevant‚Äù without stopping playback so that I can improve my recommendations.*
3. *As a user, I want a gamified challenge during my first session so that I can train the AI quickly while having fun.*

**Technical Tasks**
- [ ] Design mood & genre onboarding UI
- [ ] Implement onboarding API integration to seed recommendations
- [ ] Add "Not Relevant" quick tap UI and event tracking
- [ ] Build gamified ‚ÄúFind Your First Favorite‚Äù flow
- [ ] Integrate analytics to log feedback events
- [ ] Deploy onboarding & feedback flow to staging

---

### **Sprint 2 ‚Äì Closed-Loop Learning & Playlist Refresh**
**Goal:** Adapt recommendations in near real-time based on feedback.

**User Stories**
1. *As a system, I want to detect spikes in skip rates so that I can flag outdated music recommendations.*
2. *As a system, I want to retrain the recommendation model within hours of significant feedback so that recommendations remain relevant.*
3. *As a user, I want my playlists refreshed weekly so that I always have something new to listen to.*

**Technical Tasks**
- [ ] Implement skip pattern detection logic
- [ ] Create real-time retraining pipeline
- [ ] Set up weekly playlist refresh scheduler
- [ ] Integrate retraining output into recommendation API
- [ ] Log and monitor retraining events
- [ ] Deploy adaptive recommendation engine to staging

---

### **Sprint 3 ‚Äì Testing & Validation**
**Goal:** Ensure recommendations improve engagement before public launch.

**User Stories**
1. *As a product team, we want to measure skip rate reduction so that we can confirm recommendations have improved.*
2. *As a product team, we want to measure engagement lift so that we can validate feature success.*
3. *As a product team, we want to monitor ‚ÄúNot Relevant‚Äù feedback adoption so that we can ensure users are using the feedback loop.*

**Technical Tasks**
- [ ] Design A/B testing framework for old vs. adaptive recommendations
- [ ] Run engagement metrics tracking (skip rate, listening time, retention)
- [ ] Collect user feedback via in-app survey
- [ ] Fix bugs found during testing
- [ ] Prepare release notes & deployment checklist
