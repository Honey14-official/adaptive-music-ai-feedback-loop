## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Sprint Breakdown

---

### **Sprint 1 ‚Äì Backend Setup & Database**
**Goal:** Build a solid foundation for storing and retrieving user data.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Python backend (FastAPI or Flask)
- [ ] Design PostgreSQL schema:
  - `users` table
  - `listening_history` table
  - `feedback_events` table
- [ ] Integrate Redis for real-time skip tracking
- [ ] Implement `/recommendations/initial` API
- [ ] Test database connections

**Deliverable:** Working backend with initial recommendations API connected to DB.

---

### **Sprint 2 ‚Äì Frontend Onboarding & Recommendations**
**Goal:** Allow first-time users to select preferences and see initial playlists.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build onboarding UI in React Native
- [ ] Implement genre/mood selection flow
- [ ] Connect onboarding to `/recommendations/initial` API
- [ ] Display playlists on home screen

**Deliverable:** First-time user onboarding flow with working playlist display.

---

### **Sprint 3 ‚Äì Feedback Capture & Event Logging**
**Goal:** Record explicit and implicit user feedback.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build "Not Relevant" feedback pop-up
- [ ] Implement skip/like/dislike buttons
- [ ] Connect feedback UI to `/feedback` API
- [ ] Log playback events via `/events/playback` API

**Deliverable:** All feedback and playback events recorded in DB.

---

### **Sprint 4 ‚Äì AI Model Integration & Retraining Logic**
**Goal:** Adapt recommendations based on user behavior.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement skip pattern detection (threshold-based)
- [ ] Integrate initial AI recommendation model
- [ ] Create retraining pipeline (incremental updates)
- [ ] Expose `/model/retrain` API
- [ ] Update playlists post-retraining

**Deliverable:** AI model adapts recommendations when skip rate threshold is met.

---

### **Sprint 5 ‚Äì Engagement Validation & Testing**
**Goal:** Measure if retraining improved recommendations.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build internal engagement dashboard
- [ ] Track skip rate and engagement time
- [ ] Conduct internal QA testing
- [ ] Fix major bugs

**Deliverable:** Dashboard confirms engagement improvements.

---

### **Sprint 6 ‚Äì Final Refinements & Deployment**
**Goal:** Prepare MVP for release.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Optimize API performance
- [ ] Implement basic error handling
- [ ] Deploy backend to AWS EC2/Beanstalk
- [ ] Deploy frontend build to app stores (TestFlight, Play Store internal testing)

**Deliverable:** Fully functional MVP ready for user testing.
