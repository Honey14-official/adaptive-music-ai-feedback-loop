# üöÄ Deployment Plan ‚Äì Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## üéØ Purpose
This document outlines how the **MVP will be deployed, monitored, and scaled** to ensure a smooth launch and reliable operation post-release.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Goals
- Deliver a **stable and performant** application to real users
- Ensure **zero downtime** during rollout
- Enable **fast issue resolution** with proper monitoring and logging
- Create a **scalable infrastructure** to handle future growth

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Hosting |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Development** | Local developer testing | Local machines |
| **Staging** | Full system integration testing | AWS EC2 / RDS (staging setup) |
| **Production** | Live application for end users | AWS EC2 / RDS (production setup) |

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Steps

### Step 1 ‚Äì Pre‚ÄëDeployment Checklist
- ‚úÖ All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set for staging/production
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied
- ‚úÖ AI model validated and stored in S3

---

### Step 2 ‚Äì Backend Deployment
1. Push code to **`main`** branch (GitHub Actions auto-deploys to AWS)
2. Apply database migrations with Alembic
3. Start FastAPI backend via Gunicorn/Uvicorn
4. Verify API endpoints via Postman smoke tests

---

### Step 3 ‚Äì Frontend Deployment
1. Build React Native app for iOS & Android
2. Distribute builds:
   - **iOS:** TestFlight for beta ‚Üí App Store for production
   - **Android:** Google Play Internal Test ‚Üí Production
3. Verify onboarding, recommendation, and feedback flows

---

### Step 4 ‚Äì AI Model Update Deployment
1. Upload retrained model to AWS S3
2. Update backend to pull new model version
3. Run functional test to verify recommendations adapt correctly

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Logging

### Monitoring
- **AWS CloudWatch:** CPU, memory, API request metrics
- **Sentry:** Frontend and backend error tracking
- **Google Firebase Analytics:** User engagement metrics

### Logging
- Store all feedback events and retraining logs in PostgreSQL
- Maintain retraining job logs in AWS CloudWatch

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Rollback Strategy
- Keep **last stable release** in AWS AMI snapshot
- If deployment fails:
  1. Stop new instances
  2. Redeploy last stable build
  3. Debug and patch issues before retry

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Scaling Plan
- Enable **AWS Auto Scaling Groups** to handle traffic spikes
- Use **Redis caching** for faster API responses
- Implement **sharding** or read-replica databases when user base grows

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Post‚ÄëDeployment Actions
- Run **24-hour monitoring window** after release
- Collect **user feedback** via in-app prompts
- Schedule **weekly AI retraining** during early adoption phase

---

## üìå Next Step in ACSPO Flow
Proceed to **`retrospective.md`** after initial MVP launch to analyze what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and how to improve for the next iteration.
