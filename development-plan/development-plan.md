# 🚀 Development Plan – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This plan outlines the **technical stack, milestones, and deployment roadmap** for building the MVP.

---

## 1️⃣ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React Native (cross-platform mobile)
- **UI Library:** NativeBase or Material UI for React Native
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **Navigation:** React Navigation
- **API Calls:** Axios

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache Layer:** Redis (for real-time skip tracking)
- **AI Model Serving:** TensorFlow or PyTorch with FastAPI endpoints
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth
- **Event Streaming (optional future):** Apache Kafka

### DevOps & Hosting
- **Backend Hosting:** AWS EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk
- **Database Hosting:** AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
- **File Storage (if album art storage needed):** AWS S3
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch / Sentry

---

## 2️⃣ Development Milestones

### Milestone 1 – Backend Setup (Week 1–2)
- Setup FastAPI project structure
- Initialize PostgreSQL schema
- Implement initial `/recommendations/initial` API
- Basic unit tests for backend

---

### Milestone 2 – Frontend Onboarding (Week 3–4)
- Build onboarding flow (genre, mood, artist selection)
- Connect onboarding to backend APIs
- Initial playlist display on home screen

---

### Milestone 3 – Feedback Loop Integration (Week 5–6)
- Implement skip and dislike event logging
- Create "Not Relevant" feedback UI
- Store feedback events in backend
- Build feedback analysis service

---

### Milestone 4 – AI Model & Retraining (Week 7–8)
- Integrate base AI recommendation model
- Implement skip rate detection logic
- Build retraining pipeline with recent listening data
- Endpoint for model updates

---

### Milestone 5 – Engagement Dashboard (Week 9)
- Build internal dashboard for metrics
- Track skip rate and listening time
- Display retraining history

---

### Milestone 6 – Testing & Deployment (Week 10–11)
- End-to-end QA testing
- Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Deploy backend to AWS
- Publish app to TestFlight & Play Store internal testing

---

## 3️⃣ Deployment Strategy

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- ✅ Backend deployed to staging
- ✅ Frontend builds tested on iOS and Android
- ✅ AI model retraining validated
- ✅ Feedback capture tested in real-world scenarios

### Launch Plan
1. **Internal Alpha Testing** – Invite limited team for bug discovery  
2. **Beta Release** – Invite selected users for feedback  
3. **Public Launch** – Roll out on App Store and Google Play  

---

## 4️⃣ Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| AI model fails to adapt quickly | Medium | Increase retraining frequency |
| High server costs | High | Optimize queries and use caching |
| Low engagement in beta | High | Add onboarding incentives |
