# 🔄 Retrospective – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This document records the **lessons learned, successes, and improvement areas** after the MVP launch.  
The goal is to **continuously improve** the product in line with ACSPO principles.

---

## 1️⃣ Retrospective Goals
- Capture **what worked well**
- Identify **what didn’t work**
- Define **actionable improvements**
- Strengthen **team collaboration** and processes

---

## 2️⃣ Team Feedback Process
- **Step 1:** Collect anonymous feedback via Google Forms
- **Step 2:** Conduct a 1-hour retrospective meeting
- **Step 3:** Prioritize action items using MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t)
- **Step 4:** Assign owners for improvements

---

## 3️⃣ Retrospective Questions
During the meeting, every team member answers:
1. **What went well?**
2. **What didn’t go well?**
3. **What did we learn?**
4. **What should we do differently next time?**

---

## 4️⃣ Example Retrospective Notes

### ✅ What Went Well
- AI successfully adapted to changes in user taste after feedback
- Low crash rate (99.3% crash-free sessions)
- Positive UAT feedback from indie music listeners

### ❌ What Didn’t Go Well
- AI retraining took longer than expected (average 12 hours)
- Some users still received irrelevant recommendations
- Limited diversity in indie track suggestions

### 📚 What We Learned
- Shorter retraining cycles improve relevance
- Feedback button needs to be more prominent in UI
- Recommendation diversity impacts user retention
