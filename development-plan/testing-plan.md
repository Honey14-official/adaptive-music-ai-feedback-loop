# 🧪 Testing Plan – Adaptive Music AI with Closed-Loop Learning

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This document outlines the **QA strategy, testing types, and tools** to ensure the MVP is **bug-free, performant, and user-friendly** before launch.

---

## 1️⃣ Testing Goals
- Ensure **all core features work** as intended (recommendations, feedback loop, AI retraining)
- Verify **app stability** across devices (iOS & Android)
- Maintain **security & data privacy**
- Measure **performance & responsiveness**

---

## 2️⃣ Testing Types

| Type | Description | Tools |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Unit Testing** | Test individual components and backend endpoints in isolation | PyTest (backend), Jest (frontend) |
| **Integration Testing** | Test interaction between frontend and backend | Postman, Cypress |
| **Functional Testing** | Validate core features (onboarding, recommendations, feedback loop) | Manual QA + Selenium |
| **UI/UX Testing** | Check design consistency and usability | Figma prototype review, BrowserStack |
| **Performance Testing** | Load and stress test backend APIs | Locust, JMeter |
| **Security Testing** | Check authentication, authorization, and vulnerabilities | OWASP ZAP, JWT.io verification |
| **Regression Testing** | Ensure new changes don't break old features | Automated CI/CD tests |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Real users test the app for feedback | TestFlight, Google Play Internal Test |

---

## 3️⃣ Test Coverage Areas

### Backend
- ✅ `/auth` endpoints
- ✅ `/onboarding/preferences` data save
- ✅ `/recommendations` accuracy & response time
- ✅ `/feedback/skip` data capture
- ✅ `/ai/retrain` job execution

### Frontend
- ✅ Onboarding flow works smoothly
- ✅ Playlist cards display correctly
- ✅ Skip and feedback buttons function correctly
- ✅ AI recommendation updates visible after retraining

---

## 4️⃣ Test Environments
- **Local** – Developer machines
- **Staging** – AWS staging server for integrated tests
- **Production** – Final deployment

---

## 5️⃣ QA Workflow

1. **Developer Testing (Local)**
   - Unit tests written for new features
   - Linting and code style check

2. **Integration Testing (Staging)**
   - Test full flow: onboarding → listening → feedback → new recommendations

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Automated GitHub Actions run on each PR

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - Invite beta testers
   - Collect structured feedback

5. **Production Verification**
   - Smoke testing after deployment

---

## 6️⃣ Tools & Setup
- **Backend Testing:** PyTest, Postman, Locust
- **Frontend Testing:** Jest, Cypress
- **Device Testing:** BrowserStack, TestFlight, Google Play Internal
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions

---

## 7️⃣ Success Criteria
- **Pass Rate:** 95%+ tests passed
- **Crash-Free Sessions:** ≥ 99%
- **API Response Time:** ≤ 500ms average
- **User Feedback:** 80%+ positive UAT responses
